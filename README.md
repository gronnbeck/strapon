# strapon

Strapon enables you to bootstrap a new mac environment. 
This is tailored to my setup so you might want to do some changes.

You absolutely want to change the url to the dotvim repository, 
and also make changes to the ansible playbook if you are not using Vundle.vim to manage vim plugins.

Run with ./strapon.sh, you will be prompted for sudo password.
